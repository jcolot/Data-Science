## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r covid19}
library(COVID19)
library(tidyverse)
# Get COVID19 data from Belgium at national level
data1 <- covid19(country=c("Belgium"),start="2020-03-01", verbose=FALSE)
data1 <- data1[data1$date<=(Sys.Date()-2),] # Remove last 2 days, may still be incomplete
data1 <- data1 %>% arrange(date) %>% group_by(administrative_area_level_1) %>% mutate(confirmed_daily=c(data1$confirmed[1],diff(confirmed))) %>% ungroup() # Add daily confirmed cases


# Get COVID19 data from Belgium at regional level
data2 <- covid19(country=c("Belgium"),start="2020-03-01",level=2, verbose=FALSE)
data2 <- data2[data2$date<=(Sys.Date()-2),] # Remove last 2 days, may still be incomplete


# Get COVID19 data from multiple countries at national level
data3 <- covid19(country=c("Belgium","CZE","Netherlands","France","Germany","United Kingdom"),start="2020-03-01", verbose=FALSE)
data3 <- data3[data3$date<=(Sys.Date()-2),] # Remove last 2 days, may still be incomplete 


# In case the code above fails to download the data, please load a pre-downloaded version here:
# load(".../data/covid19_belgium.RData")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
